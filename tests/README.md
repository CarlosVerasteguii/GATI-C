# GATI-C Refactor Safety Net

**Minimalist Playwright tests for refactor confidence.**

## 🎯 Purpose

This safety net provides confidence during the massive frontend refactor from Spanish to English field names. The tests are designed to **fail automatically** when we change field names, acting as our early warning system.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (one time)
npm install
npx playwright install

# Run safety net tests
npm run test:e2e-safety-net
```

## 📋 What These Tests Do

### 1. **Application Load Test**
- Verifies the application loads without crashing
- Ensures basic HTML structure is present

### 2. **Main Pages Test**
- Verifies all main application pages are accessible
- Tests login, dashboard, and inventory pages

### 3. **Spanish Content Detection Test** ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT**
- **This is the key test that will break during refactor**
- Detects current Spanish field names in the application
- Will fail when we change Spanish → English field names
- Acts as our automatic early warning system

## 🔄 Refactor Workflow

### Before Refactoring
```bash
npm run test:e2e-safety-net  # ✅ Should pass (Spanish field names visible)
```

### During Refactoring
```bash
# Change field names in code...
npm run test:e2e-safety-net  # ❌ Will fail (Spanish fields no longer exist)
```

### After Refactoring
```bash
# Update test to use English field names
npm run test:e2e-safety-net  # ✅ Should pass (English field names visible)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

- **Browser:** Chromium only (fastest)
- **Server:** Auto-starts with `npm run dev`
- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000`

## 🛠️ Files

- `playwright.config.ts` - Minimal configuration
- `tests/refactor-safety-net.spec.ts` - The 3 critical tests
- `package.json` - `test:e2e-safety-net` script

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ **Tests pass before refactor** (Spanish content detected) - **ACHIEVED**
- ❌ **Tests fail during refactor** (Spanish → English transition)
- ✅ **Tests pass after refactor** (English content detection implemented)

## 📊 Current Test Results

**All 3 tests PASSING** ✅ (51 seconds total runtime)
- ✅ Application loads successfully
- ✅ All main pages accessible
- ✅ Spanish content detected in inventory

**Ready for refactor!** 🚀

This is **not** a comprehensive QA suite. It's a **safety net** to prevent catastrophic oversights during the refactor.
