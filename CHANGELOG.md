### Deprecated
- Marked as obsolete the direct use of `AppLayout` in individual pages

### Removed
- Deleted duplicate page in `app/dashboard/page.tsx` that caused route conflict with `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Removed duplicate component `app/app-layout.tsx` to avoid confusion with `components/app-layout.tsx`
- Deleted duplicate route `app/configuracion/page.tsx` that caused conflict with `app/(app)/configuracion/page.tsx`

  - Column configuration toasts (visibility, sorting)
  - View change notifications (immediately visible)
- ...

### Security
- **Secure Validation:** Toasts do not expose sensitive technical information
- **Input Sanitization:** Real-time validation prevents security errors
- **Audit Logs:** Complete traceability for CFE government compliance

## [v8.1] - 2024-XX-XX

### Added
- **Diagnostic Documentation:** The file `docs-setup.md` was created to document common startup problems and their solutions.
- **Maintenance Script:** Added the script `reset-project.ps1` to automate cleaning the development environment (removing `node_modules`, `.next`, etc.).

### Fixed
- **Dependency Conflict:** `peer dependency` problems were resolved by reinstalling packages with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
- **Local Environment:** Created a `.env.local` file to ensure that required environment variables for startup are present.
- **Background Processes:** Documented the method to identify and stop Node.js processes that might occupy the development port.

**Note:** This changelog marks the first functional version in the local development environment (`localhost`).
